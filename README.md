ü¶æ **About Forcething Speed:**

*Forcething Speed* is a smart and cost-effective training device designed to offer continous tracking of exercise performance. The system allows users to replace expensive professional equipment with an affordeble option. This product and others like it can substitute coaches and cameras with personal equipment that the users can monitor themself. The core feature of the device is the ability to monitor speed, providing users with valuable feedback on their training, whether they are focusing on strength training or explosive exercises like sprinting.

By leveraging a motor and an O-Drive system, the device measures force and speed during workouts and displays this data on a computer screen for the user to monitor. The goal is to enhance workout efficiency and give athletes the tools to track their performance without the high cost of traditional equipment.

üõ†Ô∏è **Design:**

The *Forcething Speed* system is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. It integrates:
- **AC or DC motor** to drive force and speed measurements.
- **O-Drive system** for precision tracking of exercises.
- **Continous feedback** for athletes to monitor speed, force, and weight lifted.
- **Compact design** that eliminates the need for large or expensive training equipment, making it ideal for versatile use in various exercises, from weight lifting to sprint training.

This user-friendly design supports a wide range of exercises, allowing athletes to focus on maximizing their performance.
The design of the motor housing in the CAD files are based on a housing for the Odrive-D6374 dual shaft motor that uses an CUI AMT102 type encoder bolted to the housing.

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works:**

The system works by utilizing the motor to control and measure speed and force during exercises. The data is processed and displayed on a screen, allowing the user to track:
- **Speed** of their movements, crucial for measuring progres in sprints.
- **Force** exerted during exercises, key for strength training.
- **Actual weight lifted** based on motor output, providing a direct alternative to traditional weights.

This combination of data gives users comprehensive feedback on their workouts, helping them optimize their performance and adjust their techniques as needed.

üìä **Results:**

Initial testing of *Forcething Speed* focused on making sure the program accurately tracked speed and that the measurments could be stored in an accessible way. This was an important function of the product as an accurate measurment tool and making sure thatthe progress could be measured. A challenge during development was perfecting the speed calculation function, which allows users to track their running speed when connected to the system.

To further improve the device, an external battery is planned to ensure a stable power supply, enhancing portability and ease of use.
